# TT Environment Mapping Guidelines

## When is Motorway Coding Required?
If Motorway coding is required, then:
- **Controlled Access (CA)** = Yes  
- **Limited Access (LA)** = Yes  
- **Route Type** = RT2

RT2 must be coded **only** on sections that are Motorways (i.e., CA = Yes).

## Geometry Guidelines for TT Environments
In TT environments (e.g., `WEU_TT_BW`), the geometry must be **highly accurate** so that it aligns with the **real road surface**.

- This alignment is visible best on HD level with LiDAR data.
- However, it should be applied as **precisely as possible** even at the SD level.

Try to ensure the geometry lies exactly within the real-world road boundaries.
